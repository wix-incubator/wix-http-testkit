# HTTP Testkit

Overview
========

Wix Http Testkit is a library that will address many of the End-to-end testing concerns you might encounter.

Wix HTTP Testkit aims to be:
* __Simple__ Testing REST services or starting mock/stub servers is very simple and requires very few lines of code.
* __Fast__ Leveraging [Akka-Http](https://github.com/akka/akka-http) infrastructure, starting servers takes milliseconds.
* __Integrated__: Other than providing a set of DSLs to support composing and executing REST HTTP calls and creating and configuring web servers, it also contains out of the box matcher libraries for [Specs<sup>2</sup>](http://wix.github.io/accord/specs2.html) to easily validate each aspect of the tested flow.
